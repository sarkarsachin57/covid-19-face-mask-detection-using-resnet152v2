# covid-19-face-mask-detection-using-resnet152v2

I have developed a model that can predict or detect a person wear face masks or not by analysing the image or video. The model is a well known Transer Learning algorithm Resnet152V2 from Keras Applications. Before going to use Resnet152V2,I also tried with Deep Learning algorithm Convolution Neural Network or CNN. But this CNN hardly give 85 - 90 % accuracy for test dataset. But by Resnet152V2, I got 100 % of accuracy for this problem statment. After developed the model  and analysis its performances, I build the face mask detection system using OpenCV or cv2 Library to capture the video from webcam and return the same with predictions ('Mask detected' or 'Mask not Detected').
